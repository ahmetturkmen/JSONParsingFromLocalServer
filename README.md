# JSONParsingFromLocalServer
This repo is just about getting info from local host, which is written using PHP, this info that is written in PHP, taken from my repo SQLiteExample. The same tables (cars and persons) are created with using MySQL data base with help of WAMP server(you can download it here : http://www.wampserver.com/en/), by the way using localhost with help of WAMP server requires SQL services disabled.You can disable them all from services section in task manager for Windows machines. After you installed WAMP server, PHP admin page should be accesible from localhost, to go there you can click WAMP server icon right-bottom of the screen by selecting PHP admin page. After these steps, you should be accessed ( a kind of GUI app on web ), you can easily create DATABASES there by clicking buttons.

After that, you can skip writing PHP codes for your DBs as we did in SQLiteExample.
